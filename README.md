# CPE325_MSP430f5529
CPE 325: Embedded Systems Laboratory @ UAH (Demo programs for EXP-MSP430F5529lp Launchpad)

This repository contains demonstration programs for the **CPE 325: Embeddedd Systems Laboratory** course taught at the **University of Alabama in Huntsville**. The programs are targeting the TI's EXP-MSP530F5529lp Launchpad board. 

## Laboratory 0:

Laboratory 0 demonstrates the installation procedure for **Code Composer Studio** CCS in a Windows machine. Code Composer Studio is the IDE from **Texas Instruments** that will be used for this course. Please find the demo file for toggling the LEDs to verify setup at [this link](Lab0/Lab0_D0.c).
