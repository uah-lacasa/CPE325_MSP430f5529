# CPE 325: Embedded Systems Laboratory @ The University of Alabama in Huntsville
Demonstration programs for the MSP-EXP430F5529LP.

This repository contains demonstration programs for the **CPE 325: Embedded Systems Laboratory** course taught at **The University of Alabama in Huntsville** (UAH). The programs in this repository are targeting the [MSP-EXP430F5529LP](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430F5529LP) LaunchPad board by **Texas Instruments** (TI). Please refer to the official [UAH LACASA site](http://lacasa.uah.edu/portal/index.php/teaching/47-cpe-323-introduction-to-embedded-computer-systems) for all tutorial documents.

## [Lab 00](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab00)
- Lab 00 demonstrates the installation procedure for [**Code Composer Studio**](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) (CCS) on a Windows machine. CCS is the integrated development environment (IDE) from TI that will be used for this course.

## [Lab 01](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab01)
- Lab 01 discusses various aspects of using the CCS IDE. This lab is designed to give students basic knowledge on debugging, compiling, and inspecting various aspects of the program while using CCS.

## [Lab 02](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab02)
- Lab 02 discusses different data types and their representation in memory. It also deals with conversion of numbers between different bases.

## [Lab 03](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab03)
- Lab 03 discusses basic digital I/O interfacing using MSP430 microcontrollers. It introduces the board and using MSP430 parallel ports to interface LEDs and switches.

## [Lab 04](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab04)
- Lab 04 discusses assembly language programming for MSP430 microcontrollers. It demonstrates a simple program that counts the occurrences of a character in a string. 

## [Lab 05](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab05)
- Lab 05 discusses subroutines and different ways for passing parameters to subroutines. It also demonstrates how to use MSP430 hardware multiplier to speed up computation.

## [Lab 06](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab06)
- Lab 06 discusses interrupts in MSP430. It demonstrates handling interrupts triggered by switches and their use for performing various tasks. It also discusses the MSP430 clock system and how to change the clock frequency of the microcontroller.

## [Lab 07](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab07)
- Lab 07 discusses different timers in the MSP430 microcontroller. It demonstrates the used of the MSP430 watchdog timer and Timer_A peripherals.

## [Lab 08](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab08)
- Lab 08 discusses UART type of serial communication using USCI peripheral. It demonstrates the use of UART serial for communication to development workstation. 

## [Lab 09](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab09)
- Lab 09 discusses Analog-to-Digital conversion using the MSP430's ADC12 peripheral. It demonstrates interfacing its internal temperature sensor, measuring chip temperature and reporting it to the development workstation. 

## [Lab 10](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab10)
- Lab 10 discusses software reverse engineering techniques and tools. It demonstrates the flow for software reverse engineering from a retrieved binary file.
