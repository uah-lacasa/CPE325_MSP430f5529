# CPE 325: Embedded Systems Laboratory @ The University of Alabama in Huntsville
Demonstration programs for the MSP-EXP430F5529LP.

This repository contains demonstration programs for the **CPE 325: Embeddedd Systems Laboratory** course taught at **The University of Alabama in Huntsville** (UAH). The programs in this repository are targeting the [MSP-EXP430F5529LP](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430F5529LP) LaunchPad board by **Texas Instruments** (TI). Please refer to the official [UAH LACASA site](http://lacasa.uah.edu/portal/index.php/teaching/47-cpe-323-introduction-to-embedded-computer-systems) for all tutorial documents.

## [Lab 00](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab00)
- Lab 00 demonstrates the installation procedure for [**Code Composer Studio**](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) (CCS) on a Windows machine. CCS is the integrated development environment (IDE) from TI that will be used for this course. Please find the demo file for toggling the LEDs to verify setup [here](Lab0/Lab0_D0.c). 

## [Lab 01](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab01)
- Lab 01 discusses various aspects of using the CCS IDE. This lab is designed to give students basic knowledge on debugging, compiling, and inspecting various aspects of the program while using CCS.

## [Lab 02](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab02)
- Lab 02 discusses different data types and their representation in memory. It also deals with conversion of numbers beten different bases.

## [Lab 03](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab03)
- Lab 03 discusses interfacing information for MSP430 microcontrollers. First, the board in use will be introduced. Then, students will be introduced with initializing inputs and outputs using parallel ports to interface LEDs and Switches.

## [Lab 04](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab04)
- Lab 04 discusses assembly language programming for MSP430 microcontrollers. This lab will demonstrate a simple program to count the occurrences of a character in a string. 

## [Lab 05](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab05)
- Lab 05 discusses subroutines and different ways of passing parameters to the subroutines. This lab will also see how to use a hardware multiplier that is present on the board.

## [Lab 06](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab06)
- Lab 06 discusses interrupts in MSP430. This lab will teach how to handle interrupts from interfacing switches and use these interrupts for different operations. Students will also study the clock system and change the operating frequency of the microcontroller.

## [Lab 07](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab07)
- Lab 07 discusses different timers in the MSP430 microcontroller using MSP430F5529 as an example. This lab will also discuss the watchdog timer. The demo codes will demonstrate how to configure the different timers in different modes and use them to control peripherals.

## [Lab 08](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab08)
- Lab 08 discusses serial communication using UART module on the MSP430 microcontroller. This is so the microcontroller can talk to the PC or any device that supports UART communication.

## [Lab 09](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab09)
- Lab 09 discusses the Analog-to-Digital Converter. One of the demo codes will interface the internal temperature sensor and print the temperature using UART communication on the PC. Another demo code will interface an analong thumbstick.

## [Lab 10](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab10)
- Lab 10 discusses reverse engineering techniques. Students will be provided an executable and are tasked to decode what the program is doing.
