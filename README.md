final commit# CPE 325: Embedded Systems Laboratory @ The University of Alabama in Huntsville
Demonstration programs for the MSP-EXP430F5529LP.

This repository contains demonstration code files for programs to be used with MSP430F5529LP boards. The course **Introduction to Embedded Computer Systems** i.e. CPE 323 and the corequisite laboratory CPE 325 **Embedded Systems Laboratory** at **The University of Alabama in Huntsville** deals with practical programming with MSP430 microcontrollers. Please refer to the official [UAH LACASA bsite](http://lacasa.uah.edu/portal/index.php/teaching/47-cpe-323-introduction-to-embedded-computer-systems) for all tutorial documents.

## [Lab 00](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab00)
- Lab 00 demonstrates the installation procedure for [**Code Compose Studio**](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) (CCS) on a Windows machine. CCS is the integrated development environment (IDE) from **Texas Instruments** that will be used for this course. Please find the demo file for toggling the LEDs to verify setup [here](Lab0/Lab0_D0.c). 

## [Lab 01](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab01)
- Lab 01 discusses various aspects of using the CCS IDE. This lab is designed to give students basic knowledge on debugging, compiling, and inspecting various aspects of the program while using CCS.

## [Lab 02](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab02)
- Lab 02 discusses different data types and their representation in memory. It also deals with conversion of numbers beten different bases.

## [Lab 03](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab03)
- Lab 03 discusses interfacing information for MSP430 microcontrollers. First, the board in use will be introduced. Then, students will be introduced with initializing inputs and outputs using parallel ports to interface LEDs and Switches.

## [Lab 04](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab04)
- Lab 04 discusses assembly language programming for MSP430 microcontrollers.  will demonstrate a simple program to count the occurrences of a character in a string. 

## [Lab 05](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab05)
- Lab 05 discusses subroutines and different ways of passing parameters to the subroutines.  will also see how to use a hardware multiplier that is present on the board.

## [Lab 06](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab06)
- Lab 06 discusses interrupts in MSP430.  will handle interrupts from interfacing switches and use these interrupts for different operations.  will also study the clock system and change the operating frequency of the microcontroller.

## [Lab 07](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab07)
- Lab 07 discusses different timers in the MSP430 microcontroller using MSP430F5529 as an example.  will also discuss the watchdog timer. The demo codes will demonstrate how to configure the different timers in different modes and use them to control peripherals.

## [Lab 08](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab08)
- Lab 08 discusses serial communication using UART module on the MSP430 microcontroller. This is so the microcontroller can talk to the PC or any device that supports UART communication.

## [Lab 09](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab09)
- Lab 9 discusses reverse engineering techniques. Students will be provided an executable and are tasked to decode what the program is doing.

## [Lab 10](https://github.com/uah-lacasa/CPE325_MSP430f5529/tree/master/Lab10)
- Lab 10 discusses the Analog-to-Digital Converter and Digital-to-Analog Converter basics. Demo code will interface the internal temperature sensor and print the temperature using UART communication on the PC.
